PHP Web Based Lastfmstats Engine To Produce Interesting And Beautiful Infograms For Both Analysis And Art

My goal is to use the Last.FM api to pull and analysis stats and represent them in a useful and beautiful way.
Stats I'm looking to show include:
-Analysis of genre of user overall
-Analysis of genre of user over a time frame
-Analysis of listening habits, i.e. number of plays per week over a time frame
-Analysis of listening habits. i.e. Increase in genre or artist count compared to user's top 100 tracks.
